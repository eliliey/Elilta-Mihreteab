         <p>
          Many of Americans are still breathing unhealthy air, and the burden is not evenly shared. Some communities are disproportionately impacted by air pollution - those facing the greatest burden are certain communities of color and low-income communities. These communites are disproportionately exposed to the most dangerous air pollutants known as PM. </p>

        Effects of Air pollution on the communities of color
      </h2>

      <p>
        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        The  effect of air pollution(bad air quality) are overwhelmingly
        concentrated in communities of color. The lasting implications of
        segregation and redlining mean that People
        of Color(Black , Asian, and Hispanic communities) are more likely to live near freeways, oil and gas drilling
        sites, and other pollutants, and their communities have higher rates of
        air pollution. Resultantly, people of color experience more chronic diseases such
        as asthma, heart attacks and strokes, lung diseadse reproductive harm, premature birth and low-birth weight, and even early death.
